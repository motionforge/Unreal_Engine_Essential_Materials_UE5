# Unreal_Essential_Materials_UE5
 
This Unreal Engine Project contains a selection of Materials and Material Functions that can be used for most if not all surfaces.

I've been building this collection as I go along making and creating new materials so it will be further updated and improved. My aim for this material set is not to create specific material types, such as sandstone or flint, but to create base templates that can be used to create any specific materials (although what defines this can be a grey line at times!).

Please do contribute (fork) if you can see where improvements or new additions can be made. But please note the contribution guidelines. Mainly keep file sizes as low as possible, use only creative commons assets if necessary, and try to stick to master material templates.

It comes with a set of textures that are all in creative commons and downloaded from:

List of Materials:

Simple.
Simple Blend with two '3 vector' nodes.
Standard - A little more advanced with Colour/Rough/Normal and a switch for using a diffuse texture or just a base colour.
Bump - Standard material with a height map.
Parralax Occulation - A more advanced height map material. Similar to bump, better look, but more demanding of system resources.
Displacement - Displaces the mesh.
Opacity - Parts of the material are transparent or hidden.
Cloth
Emissive
Pulsing
Dissolve
Metallic
Glass
Frosted Glass
Distorted Glass
Water
Slimy Water
Carbon Fibre
Clear Coat
Clear Coat - No Bottom
Parameter collection example
Curtain wind animation material - Doesn't just have to be a curtain - but best with cloth and flexible meshes.
Ground
Master Material - Most of the materials here can be made from this material if required.
Vertex Painted Material
Vertex Puddle painting Material.
Material Functions Example
Masked and two sided foliage material
Wheat Field with noise texture to create a wind effect (this uses a photo I got from pixabay - the effect can be improved by using high quality textures from megascans or another library)
A simple Landscape material with 5 layers for painting.
Light Function material
Sky Material for Sky Box/Sphere

# Unreal Engine Essential Materials UE5

This Unreal Engine Project contains a selection of Materials and Material Functions that can be used for most if not all surfaces.

I've been building this collection as I go along making and creating new materials so it will be further updated and improved. My aim for this material set is not to create specific material types, such as sandstone or flint, but to create base templates that can be used to create any specific materials (although what defines this can be a grey line at times!).

Please do contribute (fork) if you can see where improvements or new additions can be made. But please note the contribution guidelines. Mainly keep file sizes as low as possible, use only creative commons assets if necessary, and try to stick to master material templates.

It comes with a set of textures that are all in creative commons and downloaded from:

Moon landscape height map was created by me and is provided with the project files under the same license. 

**List of Materials:**

* Simple.
* Simple Blend with two '3 vector' nodes.
* Standard - A little more advanced with Colour/Rough/Normal and a switch for using a diffuse texture or just a base colour.
* Bump - Standard material with a height map.
* Parallax Occlusion - A more advanced height map material. Similar to bump, better look, but more demanding of system resources. 
* Opacity - Parts of the material are transparent or hidden.
* Cloth
* Emissive
* Pulsing
* Dissolve
* Metallic
* Glass
* Frosted Glass
* Distorted Glass
* Depth Fade
* Water
* Slimy Water
* Fog
* Carbon Fibre
* Clear Coat
* Clear Coat - No Bottom
* Parameter collection example
* Curtain/cloth wind animation material.
* Simple Landscape material
* Master Material - Most of the materials here can be made from this material.
* Masked Material.
* Vertex Painted Material
* Vertex Puddle painting Material.
* Material Functions Example
* Masked and two sided foliage material
* Landscape material with 5 layers for painting.
* Landscape material with non tiling (scale textures at distance). Example shown using moon landscape. 
* Light Function material
* Sky Material for Sky Box/Sphere
* World Aligned Material
* RVT (Runtime Virtual Texture)
* Wheat Field with noise texture to create a wind effect (this uses a photo I got from pixabay - the effect can be improved by using high quality textures from megascans or another library)
